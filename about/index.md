### Bio
Hi, I'm Pat! I'm a software engineer that loves to learn and try new technology.
I'm currently working with Workiva, a SaaS company focusing on audit and
regulated reporting of fortune 500 companies.

### Interests
With most of my day to day being web development, I really like to branch out
into other forms of development.

- Python C Extensions
  - When my girlfriend is out of town and I feel like getting lewd by managing my own memory,
  I've dabbled in writing a C Extension for Python. For an example, you can check out my
  (incomplete) module exposing [unix message queues for Python 3](https://gitlab.com/patoconnor43/unix-mq)
- Mobile
  - I use [https://flutter.io](Flutter) to write mobile apps, which uses [Dart](https://dartlang.org) as its language.
  Most of my apps are ugly, simple, and unfinished but it's been a fun and interesting experience.
- Functional
  - Recently I started learning [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org). I put together a super simple web server as an
  example using [Cowboy and Plug](https://gitlab.com/PatOConnor43/sample_server).
